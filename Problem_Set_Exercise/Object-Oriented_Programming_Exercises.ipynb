    "Problem Description: Fraction Class\n",
    "\n",
    "You are tasked with designing a Python class called Fraction that represents fractions and provides various methods to perform basic arithmetic operations on fractions. The Fraction class should support initialization with a numerator and an optional denominator, which defaults to 1 if not provided. The class should ensure that fractions are always in their reduced form (i.e., with the greatest common divisor of numerator and denominator removed).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Fraction class should have the following attributes and methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "Attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "nr: An integer representing the numerator of the fraction.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "dr: An integer representing the denominator of the fraction.\n",
    "Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "__init__(self, nr, dr=1): Constructor method that initializes a Fraction object with the given numerator and denominator. If the denominator is negative, it should be converted to a positive value, and the sign of the fraction should be adjusted accordingly. The fraction should then be reduced to its simplest form using the _reduce() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "show(self): A method that prints the fraction in the format \"numerator/denominator\".\n",
    "\n",
    "multiply(self, other): A method that multiplies the current fraction with another fraction or an integer. If the input is an integer, it will be converted into a Fraction object. The resulting fraction should be reduced to its simplest form.\n",
    "\n",
    "add(self, other): A method that adds the current fraction to another fraction or an integer. If the input is an integer, it will be converted into a Fraction object. The resulting fraction should be reduced to its simplest form.\n",
    "\n",
    "_reduce(self): A private method that reduces the fraction to its simplest form by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD). The GCD calculation is performed by the static method hcf(x, y).\n",
    "\n",
    "hcf(x, y): A method that calculates the highest common factor (HCF) or greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers x and y. The HCF is used to reduce the fractions to their simplest form.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: The Fraction class should be designed with error handling in mind. It should handle invalid inputs, such as non-integer values for the numerator and denominator, to ensure the correct behavior and stability of the class."
